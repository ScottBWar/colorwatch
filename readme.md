##A D3/Angular Graph tool 

This project is something I've been tinkering with as a way to explore using Angular and D3.js together to make dynamic graphing tools. The d3 svg graphs are generated based on data in the angular controller's $scope. A $watch checks for changes and updates the graphs with angular "magic".
