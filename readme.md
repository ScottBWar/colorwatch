##A D3/Angular option for updating d3 svg with data from $scope

This project is something I've been tinkering with as a way to explore using Angular and D3.js together to make dynamic graphing tools. The d3 svg graphs are generated based on data in the angular controller's scope. A $watch function checks for changes in that data and then updates the graphs with angular "magic".
